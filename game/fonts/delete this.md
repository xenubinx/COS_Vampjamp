This is a file only intended to be here so the fonts folder is not empty and can be checked into GitHub. Please delete this after you have cloned the repository. New to 8.1 and 7.6 of Ren'Py, the fonts folder will automatically be searched for fonts without having to specify fonts/ at the start of the file path. In earlier Ren'Py versions, you must specify the full path including the fonts/ folder at the start.
